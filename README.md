My Dot Files
============

My bash settings, shortcuts, aliases and functions.

Should work with both Bash and ZSH.

To install

1. Install ZSH
2. Install Oh My ZSH
3. Add `source ~/bin/dotfiles/zshrc` to .zshrc

I use the rather beautiful solarized Terminal theme, available at:
https://github.com/tomislav/osx-lion-terminal.app-colors-solarized

With Source Code Pro as the font.

Extra, personal, sensitive, git-ignored stuff goes in bash/extra.
